# bio for healcare resume

    I wrote my first program, hand assembled it, and typed it in hex code into
    a prototype GE PC code named "Watergate" when I was in Jr. High School. 
    Since them I have programmed everything from embedded systems to super computers. 
    I have always been fascinated by the concept of computing.

    I have developed software for mathematical modeling, data storage &
    retrieval, expert systems, enterprise
    data modeling, inventory control & accountable property management, time
    billing, satellite communications, financial reporting, accounting, data mining, 
    automatic target recognition, Geo positioning systems, sensor integration, 
    international funds transfer, and web based interfaces to legacy systems.

    While in high school I assisted my mother teaching candle making and drama.
    As an adult I have taught Aikido, Self Defence, Stress Reduction, Ki
    Development, Shiatsu, Computer Programming, Computer Repair, and Candle Making. 

    I have a BA in Math & Philosophy and have studied a wide
    variety of subjects ranging from history of architecture through Traditional
    Chinese Medicine to molecular biology & neuroscience. While I
    enjoy intellectual pursuits, I also keep physically active. I love the outdoors
    (I am an Eagle Scout) and have black belts from two different international
    aikido associations (The International Ki Society & Kokyukai). I
    have also produced and edited award winning videos for ACMi.
