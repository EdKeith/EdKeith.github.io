- header: Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Clinical Decision Support System
  content: >
    Rewrote & enhanced a pharmacokinetic modeling system at CSL. 
    Assisted pharmacologists building pharmacokinetic models for treatment, research, and
    forensics. 
    On at least two occasions my models were instrumental in saving
    lives. 
    Created models for expert witness testimony in drunk driving cases.

- header: Electronic Health Records
  content: >
    Provided deployment, maintenance, support & training for the US Armyâ€™s
    Occupational Health Management Information System (OHMIS) that collected
    electronic medical records and environmental heath exposure data world wide
    and consolidated it to a central data repository.

- header: Requirements Analysis
  content: >
    Wrote requirements specification for FEMA's accounting system. Facilitated
    meetings of diverse stake holders, interviewed users, and searched legal
    documents to collect functional, work flow, & regulatory requirements and
    build a data model.

- header: Data Modeling
  content: |
    Developed & supported an enterprise data modeling tool and developed
    teaching materials for data modeling training seminars at IESC.

    Built data model to capture operational, performance, & vibration data
    to predict component failure & optimize maintenance schedule for Sikorsky's
    lift fan used in Boeing's joint strike fighter proposal while at B.F.
    Goodrich.

    Designed Geo-Centers' proposed international standard file format for
    interchange of ground penetrating focused array radar data. Each group used a
    proprietary format that implicitly assumed the unique array geometry and
    timing sequences of their system. It was necessary to develop a format which
    could explicitly encode any possible geometric and timing configuration.

- header: Web Based Interface To Legacy System
  content: >
    Developed a web based interface to a legacy retirement plan management
    system for TIAA-CREF. The system walked the user through a dynamic guided
    interview process that adapted to accommodate the answers given. The data was
    checked for inconstancies, and a virtual card deck was created and sent to
    the legacy system.

- header: Expert Systems
  content: >
    Created expert systems to automate emergency room triage for CLS, evaluate
    data models for IESC, and guide web based interviews for TIAA-CREF.

- header: Image Analysis & Feature Detection 
  content: >
    Responsible for hardware & software design for and coding of the
    infrared subsystem of Geo-Centers' vehicle mounted multi-sensor land mine
    detector. Used statistical analysis, fuzzy logic, & digital signal processing
    to analyze 3 dimensional radar data, 2 dimensional IR images, and 1
    dimensional magnetometer data to identify and locate land mines. Developed
    algorithm that greatly improved the resolution from course grained
    magnetometer data. Geo-centers considered migrating the technology for tumor
    detection, but decided not to enter the medical field.
