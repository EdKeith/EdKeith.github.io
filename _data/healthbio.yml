    I wrote my first program, hand assembled it, and typed it in hex code into
    a prototype GE PC code named "Watergate" when I was in Jr. High School. 
    Since them I have programmed everything from embedded systems to super computers. 
    I have always been fascinated by the concept of computing.

    There was an essay in the Communications of the ACM in
    the early 1990's which
    said the great thing about being a software developer was that you could
    change careers with little or no retraining. Don't like working at a bank, go
    work for a manufacturing firm; don't like working at a law firm, go work at a
    research lab, etc. This was very true for me. At that time I was working at the SEC,
    processing document related to mergers, accusations, and issuing of stock.
    Previously I have been a business consultant (I will never forget the day the
    head of a government agency called in my team
    and told us, <em>"Gentleman, we have a problem. OMB wants to know what I do. I
    need you to figure it out."</em> Made me wonder whether I was part of the problem, or
    part of the solution.) Before that I worked in health care (The feeling I got
    when I realised that a pharmacokinetic model I made had helped to save a
    life, I knew I was part of the solution), and before that I was in law publishing. 
    Since then I have worked in satellite communication, accounting, marketing, banking, 
    aerospace, and ordinance disposal.

    I have developed software for mathematical modeling, data storage &
    retrieval, expert systems, enterprise
    data modeling, inventory control & accountable property management, time
    billing, satellite communications, financial reporting, accounting, data mining, 
    automatic target recognition, Geo positioning systems, sensor integration, 
    international funds transfer, and web based interfaces to legacy systems.

    I have a BA in Math & Philosophy and have studied a wide
    variety of subjects ranging from history of architecture through Traditional
    Chinese Medicine to molecular biology & neuroscience. While I
    enjoy intellectual pursuits, I also keep physically active. I love the outdoors
    (I am an Eagle Scout) and have black belts from two different international
    aikido associations (The International Ki Society & Kokyukai). I
    have produced award winning videos, and taught candle making, C programming,
    martial arts, object oriented design, massage, computer repair, and stress reduction.
