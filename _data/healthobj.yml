# Health care objectives

heading: It's All About Healthcare

    I want to return to the health care field in hope of reclaiming the
    feeling I got when I was doing pharacokinetic modeling, when I knew 
    my model had helped to save a life.

    Having been an independent contractor for many years I am getting tired 
    of being entirely on my own. 
    I would like to get the benefits of being a full time employee and be 
    part of a team.

    My career started in health care, first doing pharmacokinatic modeling and
    Emergency Room Triage for Ceder systems Ltd., 
    then in electronic health records for the U.S. Army.
    I learned anatomy & physiology as part of my study of massage
    and martial arts and have been taking online classes in health informatics,
    bioinformatics, biostatistics, molecular biology,
    neuroscience, and medical imaging to prepare myself to reenter the
    field. 
    I am learning the science and the vocabulary so I can better understand requirements.

    Much of my experience outside of health care I believer to be transferable.
    Geo-Centers' preliminary research suggested that the code I developed to
    locate land mines in infrared images would also be able to detect cancer tumors in x-rays.
    The tools I used to target direct marketing mailings to potential costumers should also be usable in a clinical decision support system.
    My experience with business and financial data should be directly transferable to health records.

    Web, mobile & cloud based systems look like the future. 
    I am on top of all three. 
    I built my first web site in 1995 and have stayed on top of the changing technology. 
    On the client side I am conferable using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, & Bootstrap. 
    On the server side I have used Php, Python, Ruby, Javascript and C++. 
    I have developed Android apps and have taken courses on iOS development. 
    I have also studied the theoretical issues of cloud computing and have experience with Heroku, AWS, Azure &amp; the Google Cloud Platform.
